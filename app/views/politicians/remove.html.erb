<p class="guff">Politwoops tracks deleted tweets by current politicians, including those in office and candidates. Explore the collection of tweets that they didn't want you to see. If you think we're missing someone, please <a href="mailto:twoops@sunlightfoundation.com">email us</a> with their Name, State, Political Party, Office they hold or are seeking and, of course, Twitter handle.</p>
<p class="guff">In most cases, Twitter <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy">doesn't allow the storing of deleted tweets</a>, but ProPublica (and The Sunlight Foundation, which previously hosted Politwoops) is permitted to do so for politicians running for office, appointed to office or elected to office. We don't track previous candidates but do show deleted tweets
  from when they were in office or running.</p>
<p class="guff">If you aren't an elected official or running for office and feel your account is being tracked by mistake then <a href="mailto:politwoops@propublica.org">please contact us</a>.</p>
